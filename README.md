# ICS_IDS
As technology becomes ingrained in our lives more and more, our reliance on Industrial Con- trol Systems (ICSs) is ever increasing. However as shown by Stuxnet increased reliance does not always mean increased security. The source of ICSs insecurity is rooted in their origins; a time before the Internet where system security was solely physical, if at all. As devices became connected to the Internet so did ICSs, and with the adoption of common protocols they adopted their flaws, a step that systems designed solely to work in real time were not prepared for. To combat this problem many measures were suggested to secure ICSs, two of which were the use of firewalls and the deployment of a defence in depth approach to secu- rity. In this project a layered Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention (NIDPS) is created to ascertain the viability of using Machine Learning (ML) to combat this security issue. The results of this investigation suggest that, whilst effective in the majority of cases, a 99% classi- fication accuracy is unacceptable in an ICS environment due to the destructive nature of Type 2 errors in this setting.
